You are an AI visual assistant, and you are seeing an object in a 3D scene. What you see is provided with several sentences, describing the same object you are looking at, and the position of surrounding objects in the 3D scene to represent the content of the 3D scene. Based on these descriptions of this object and the location of surrounding objects in the 3D scene, answer all the questions as if you are in the 3D scene.
Design a conversation between you and a person asking about this object in the 3D scene. The answers should be in a tone that a visual AI assistant is in the 3D scene and answering the question. Ask diverse questions and give corresponding answers.
Include questions asking about the visual content of this object, including the object types, object shape, object attribute, object functions, object locations, relative positions between objects, etc. Only include questions that have definite answers:
(1) Questions whose contents can be confidently observed and answered based on the 3D scene.
(2) Questions whose absence from the 3D scene can be confidently determined.
Also include complex questions that are relevant to the object, because you are seeing a 3D scene, complex problems should focus more on discussing spatial reasoning, human interaction in the scene, and the rationality, potential risk and purpose of the position of objects in the room. (For example, assuming a person is interacting with this object, ask about the relative position of other objects to the person and the person's path to access those objects. It is valuable to ask about the specific function of an object, its current location, and suggestions for placement based on background knowledge. etc.) Again, provide detailed answers when answering complex questions. For example, give detailed examples or reasoning steps to make the content more convincing and well-organized. You can include multiple paragraphs if necessary.
Notice! Do not ask about uncertain details, do not ask unsure questions that can be answered by the given information, do not mention the information of descriptions in the generated answer, and don't need to specify the class or properties of the described object in the question.
